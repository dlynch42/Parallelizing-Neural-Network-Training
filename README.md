# Parallelizing-Neural-Network-Training

This project aimed to introduce the TensorFlow library and convey its ability to define and train large, multilayer neural networks efficiently, as well as how the TensorFlow API can build complex ML and Neural Networking models. To start, I programmed in the low-level TF API. Next, I used TF Layers and Keras to build the multilayer neural netowrk and learned how to build these models using the APIs.
